This is a TextExpander library of snippets I use to get URLs from (mostly) Safari and insert them where I'm typing. The idea is to avoid switching back and forth between apps and cluttering up the clipboard.

Each of the abbreviations is prefixed with "jj," because that's how I structure my snippets. It's easy to go in an change that after you've imported the snippets into TextExpander.
